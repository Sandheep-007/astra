\# Astra AI Assistant



Astra is a lightweight desktop voice assistant built in Python.  

It uses \*\*VOSK\*\* for wake-word detection (e.g., "Astra", "Hey Astra") and \*\*Google Speech Recognition\*\* for accurate command handling.  

Astra can launch apps, answer simple questions via web search, and interact with the user through friendly randomized responses.
